CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `myecomlulu.jackpot.lulu_customer_master` AS
-- ============================================================
-- LuLu customer master  →  feeds POST /api/v1/lulu/customers/sync
--
-- Sources
--   myecomlulu.jackpot.ksa_jackpot     one row per order (phone, name, amount, status)
--   myecomlulu.jackpot.instaleap_raw   one row per order item (store, category, price)
--
-- Output: ONE ROW PER CUSTOMER, column names match the sync API exactly,
-- so n8n needs no field mapping.
--
-- Assumptions (verify with diagnostics.sql BEFORE trusting the output)
--   1. No customer_id exists → the normalised phone number IS the customer id.
--   2. Only orders with status in `valid_statuses` count as purchases.
--   3. instaleap_raw.job_number = 'Lulu-<order number>INP1' → order number
--      is extracted and joined to ksa_jackpot.number (used ONLY for
--      preferred store / category; everything else works without the join).
--   4. A phone used by many different FIRST NAMES, or by 2+ names with an
--      implausible number of orders, is a shared/dummy number (e.g. 966558052159: 1,268
--      orders, 796 names). It is KEPT in the output but flagged with
--      `suspect_reason`, so the app can show it and exclude it from
--      campaigns, counts and scoring. E-mail count alone is not used as the
--      rule (one person can have several e-mails); it is reported for review.
--   5. The data currently starts 2026-06-30, so first_order_date is the first
--      order *in the data*, not necessarily the customer's true first order.
--   6. Categories come out as 3-digit department CODES (e.g. '006'); a
--      code → name lookup table is needed to show names.
--   7. Region: only customers whose latest order city is in `focus_cities` (western province) are
--      returned; RFM quintiles and the VIP cut-off are computed within that focus group.
--   8. Not available in these tables → not emitted: birthday, loyalty_id,
--      marketing_opt_in, language (defaults to 'ar'), active_complaint.
