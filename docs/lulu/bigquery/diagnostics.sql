-- Run these ONE AT A TIME before the first sync. Each answers a question the
-- customer_master.sql assumptions depend on.

-- 1) Which order statuses exist, and how much money is in each?
--    → decide the contents of `valid_statuses` in customer_master.sql
SELECT status, COUNT(*) AS orders, ROUND(SUM(amount), 0) AS sales,
       MIN(date_placed) AS first_seen, MAX(date_placed) AS last_seen
FROM `myecomlulu.jackpot.ksa_jackpot`
GROUP BY status ORDER BY orders DESC;

-- 2) Suspected shared / dummy phones, using the same rules as customer_master.sql
--    (> 3 different first names OR > 60 orders). Review the top of this list.

-- 3) Does the item table join to the order table?
--    Expect a high match % for recent orders. Low % → the job_number
--    assumption is wrong and preferred store/category will be empty.

-- 17) Is `amount` net or gross of discount?  discount ÷ (amount + discount) should cluster on round
--     promo percentages (10 %, 15 %, 20 %…) if amount is NET; discount ÷ amount if it is GROSS.
